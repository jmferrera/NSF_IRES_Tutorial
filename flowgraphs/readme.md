# Flowgraphs
## stereoSimulation
This flowgraph simulates a stereo audio transmitter and receiver. This can be used without hardware to test out the system and any changes you want to make.

## stereoTx
Audio transmitter. Note that this block requires hardware capable of transmitting on an ISM frequency band.

## stereoRx
Audio receiver.

## imageSimulation
This flowgraphs simulates a packeted transmission scheme using custom OOT blocks found in the code directory.
